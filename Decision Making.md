# **Assignment: Decision making**
#### **Task:**
 ● **Clients complain that the searches for a destinations sometimes fail. Head of product decided to address the issue, and ask development team to work on fix.** 
 
● **The team committed to work out the solution during August. It was agreed that the team’s bonus payout would depend on effectiveness of the solution.**  

● **The Head of Product ask you to analyze the data and help him to decide whether the team deserve the bonus?**

**Here is the link to see the results in** [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/194XMaTDwEYE6okEWqFwytMPnsHCGDEFv1gxR9r7wTAg/edit?usp=sharing)

**UNDERSTANDING DATA**
We calculate some diferent functions
##### **Result**
**August**
**Total_Users**= 841119
**Total_correct**= 834060
**Total_Error** = 12828
**Max_error** = 142
**Min_error** = 0
**Avg_error** = 4.5409
**Max_correct** = 896
**Min_correct** = 7 
**Avg_correct** = 295.2425


**September**
**Total_Users**= 866333
**Total_correct**= 858740
**Total_Error** = 8950
**Max_error** = 38
**Min_error** = 0
**Avg_error** = 3.7684
**Max_correct** = 1160
**Min_correct** = 10 
**Avg_correct** = 361.5747

We can see that *Queries_error* in August month there are some extremely high values. 

**EXPLORING DATA**
We would like to know the difference between how many users and *query_errors* ocurred in August and how many users and *query_errors* ocurred in September

##### **Result**
**%Errors_August**: 1.53%     
**%Correct_August**: 99,6%
**%Errors_September**: 1.03%     
**%Correct_September**: 99.12%

As we can see above, in August were more Query_errors than in September. It seems that the developers could have fixed some issues.

**Let's see now how is the evolution during the Month**


 We will show how many ***Query_errors*** per day have occurred during August month comparing with September Month and related to how many users has been conected.


![Gráfica](https://github.com/Lidiamasso/DAM19/blob/master/%25%20Queries_Error%20by%20Day.Excel.PNG?raw=true)

As we can see above in September month somedays queries_error where higher than in August

**Now, we will see how is the evolution by Hour**
