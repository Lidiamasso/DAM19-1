## DAM19 - 1st ASSIGMENT 

#### <u> Executive Summary </u>

* There's a decrease in the number of error from 
1.54% to 1.04% in September which represents a 0.5% less.

* The error ratio is 0.5% less even with 3972 more queries per month.

* The ratio percentage change has increased in around 32.11%.

* The members of the team has showed efficacy and a good performance in resolving the problem and all of them deserve a bonus payout.

#### <u> Case Study </u>

Because the total number of queries sales in August and September are different it is difficult to compare the data for the two years and to determine whether or not there's any notable change in solving the problem. However, if the number of errors in every month is expressed as a percentage of the total queries, then it is easier to compare the data for the two months.

Percentages are also very useful if you wish to quantify change. In this case, this is because they provide us a result in the form of parts per hundred that is usually more readily understandable and comparable than when the information is presented as raw values.

To measure these results, we decide to take into account an error ratio which it's calculated with: 

```
100.0*(#_of_errors/#_of_queries)
```

Grouped by hours along the day for the two different months as showed below:

We notice a significant decrease in the number of errors in september, however, we should sum up these figures to see the whole picture.
This process leads us to a reduction of 0.5% from August (1,54%) to September (1.04%), which represents an amount of 4129 errors.

On the other side, the number of queries has rise from 836442 to 840414 that's why I've decided to calculate the percentage change that turn into 32.11% decrease in error 

```
=100.0*(12860-8730)/12860
```

Therefore, we consider that the teamwork has been succefull and they have performed a efficient and excellent task in reducing the error in September. We have to take into account that an error ratio of 1.54% over 836442 queries implies a small number itself. Keep this number is a good job itself and reducing it represents a good job.

We conclude that a bonus payout should be provide to the team.
