### <u>FINDINGS</u>


One of the main questions is:

1. What do we consider as efficiency? Where we find a robust system with a high number of queries and a low number of errors.

2. Reducing the error ratio #errors/#queries implies improving the performance

3. The results show that the performance was really good in August with only 1.54% of errors. They have managed to reduce this quantity to 1.04% and this number represents a 47% descrease in the number of errors.
